If a dark cloud moves\n          across the sky, the grid can be taken by surprise and lose hundreds of\n          megawatts of PV generation within minutes. This lost PV generation\n          must be replaced immediately. But thermal generators take hours to\n          spin-up from cold. The end result is that, whenever the sun is\n          shining, the grid keeps lots of spinning-reserve online: mostly gas\n          turbines, which are kept idling, but not generating electricity. This\n          is expensive and carbon intensive.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The grid would require less spinning reserve if they had better PV\n          forecasts for the next few hours. That is, better PV forecasts would\n          reduce carbon emissions, and save money. In the UK, better PV\n          forecasts should save &pound;1-10 million per year (\n          <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jamie_Taylor7/project/PV-Live/attachment/58342d5c08ae5e4c8b365783/AS:431187387785227@1479814492614/download/JamieTaylor_PV_Live_v1_20161122.pdf\">\n            Taylor et al, 2016\n          </a>\n          ), and about 100,000 tonnes of CO\n          <sub>2</sub> per year.
