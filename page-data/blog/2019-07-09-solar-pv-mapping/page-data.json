Nowcasting will provide solar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> yield predictions for any location. To be able to arrive at an accurate forecast for solar power generation (out-turn), we need to know where all the <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> panels are!</p>\n<p>The OpenStreetMap (<abbr title=\"Open Street Map\">OSM</abbr>) community has already done an incredible job mapping over 10,000 <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> installations in the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> (out of over 1 million we believe to exist) and many more across the world. Our goal is to help grow the effort and drastically increase the amount of <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> mapped in <abbr title=\"Open Street Map\">OSM</abbr>.</p>\n<p>Recent research (<a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/group/deepsolar/home\">DeepSolar</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10895.pdf\">SolarMapper from DUKE</a> are just two examples) has shown the power of machine learning (<abbr title=\"Machine Learning\">ML</abbr>) for identifying <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> panels in satellite and aerial imagery at scale. We want to make it easy for anyone to start using <abbr title=\"Machine Learning\">ML</abbr> to map <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> across the world, and help pull together the datasets that are generated into a global open database (which can be used for updating <abbr title=\"Open Street Map\">OSM</abbr>).</p>\n<p>By creating a comprehensive open database of <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> installations, we think that many other people will find interesting ways to use the data.</p>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> is our initial focus for the nowcasting project, so we have also focused on mapping <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> installations there initially. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaurenceWWatson\">Laurence Watson</a> has taken up the challenge of mapping <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> using high-resolution 25cm aerial imagery. Although licensing does not allow the aerial imagery to be shared, we will be open sourcing the methods and tools we use. We are using the excellent <a href=\"https://rastervision.io/\">Raster Vision</a> framework, which will make it easier for anyone to reuse and contribute to the work.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in doing a similar <abbr title=\"Machine Learning\">ML</abbr> mapping project in your country (where we can find high resolution imagery), please reach out, as we will be happy to collaborate whilst we do the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> project.</p>\n<p>There are other groups doing similar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> mapping projects, and we are excited about the prospect of growing the community, and providing a place for these <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> datasets to live.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-you-contribute\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-can-you-contribute\" aria-label=\"how can you contribute permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How can you contribute?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Map <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> installations manually from street level or satellite imagery directly in <abbr title=\"Open Street Map\">OSM</abbr>.
