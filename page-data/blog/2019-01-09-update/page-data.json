If you're looking to work on a project (either paid or unpaid), then you'd look through this database to see if anything takes your fancy. If you're involved in a project, then you could ask for help. The emphasis would be on open-source projects which help to reduce emissions; but perhaps we'd also allow closed-source projects to advertise? Does that sound useful? If so, would a newsletter be best? Or a blog, which perhaps also publishes interviews etc. with people involved in climate change mitigation? Or a listing on github? Or a forum? Or all of the above? Or does this already exist?</p>\n<h2 id=\"scaling-up-the-research-lab\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#scaling-up-the-research-lab\" aria-label=\"scaling up the research lab permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Scaling up the research lab</h2>\n<p>For the first year or two, I'd like to focus mostly on solar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> nowcasting; and I'd like to deliberately keep the lab quite small, so that we can be experimental and agile without jeopardising lots of peoples' jobs!</p>\n<p>If the solar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> nowcasting project goes well, and if the open-source approach has proved useful, then I'd like to scale up to a few other projects.
