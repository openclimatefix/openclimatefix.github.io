Web pages are primarily written for <em>people</em>. But it turns out that machines have a hard time understanding content that's written for human consumption. To understand natural language you have to know a lot about how the world works, including how people think. Machines struggle with that.</p>\n<p>This wasn't a problem when the web was small. But, as the web grew, users needed help searching and processing information on the web. Early automated search tools often produced unsatisfactory results because they struggled to understand the web's content.</p>\n<p>Today, increasingly large numbers of web sites solve this problem using ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data\">linked data</a>’: metadata in a standard format which makes content easy for machines to understand. Linked data makes it easier to build automated tools to help us search and process vast quantities of distributed data.</p>\n<p>Linked data is sometimes called ‘Web 3.0’ and is the brainchild of Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the web). Domains such as biomedical science have used linked data for years to build very powerful, distributed representations of knowledge.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_the_next_web\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s 2009 TED talk on Linked Data</a>, he gave three \"extremely simple\" principles behind linked data. Here are those three principles applied to energy data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Every <em>thing</em> (dataset, transformer, meter, energy company, etc.) gets a unique name. Each name is a URL (a web address).</li>\n<li>If I take one of these URLs and I look it up then I get a description of that <em>thing</em>. That description will be in a standard format and will use standard naming conventions.</li>\n<li>That description also includes <em>relationships</em> by linking to URLs of related <em>things</em>. For example, a transformer would link to the meters attached to that transformer, and those meters would link to descriptions of time series datasets recorded from those meters, and those descriptions would link to the data.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"what-would-a-web-of-energy-data-look-like\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-would-a-web-of-energy-data-look-like\" aria-label=\"what would a web of energy data look like permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What would a 'web of energy data' look like?</h1>\n<p>Maybe the National Grid <abbr title=\"Electricity System Operator\">ESO</abbr> would publish linked data describing the transmission system. For example, each grid supply point (GSP) could be identified by a unique web address (e.g. NationalGridESO.com/GSP#NEWX_1). Accessing that web address would return a machine-readable file describing that GSP and linking to descriptions of the supergrid transformers that make up the GSP (see Figure below). To make life as easy as possible for the <abbr title=\"Electricity System Operator\">ESO</abbr>, this data would be converted from the <abbr title=\"Electricity System Operator\">ESO</abbr>'s existing CIM models.</p>\n<p>The DNOs could publish descriptions of the distribution system. These descriptions would be machine-readable and use a common standard, hence making it trivial to combine models from all DNOs into a description of the entire distribution system.</p>\n<p>In the figure below, the rectangles represent metadata files published on the <abbr title=\"Electricity System Operator\">ESO</abbr> and a DSO's website. Note that the DSO doesn't need to create their own representation of each GSP. Instead, the DSO's metadata just links to the <abbr title=\"Electricity System Operator\">ESO</abbr>'s description of each GSP.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclimatefix/website/master/src/images/blog/2020-08-18_image_1.png\" alt=\"ESO vs DSO Data\"></p>\n<p>DSR aggregators could publish metadata describing their portfolios and pricing, etc.</p>\n<p>So we’d end up with lots of metadata files (each describing a <em>thing</em>) scattered across the web.

So let’s build a search engine for linked energy data. But we don't want just any old search engine…</p>\n<p>Remember that the proposed metadata files describe <em>relationships</em>: they’re <em>linked</em>. In computer-science-speak, we’d say the files constitute a ‘distributed graph’, where ‘graph’ means a network of nodes (things) connected by edges (the relationships between things). So, to exploit the full power of the web of energy data, we need a search engine that can capture these relationships: a ‘knowledge graph’. This would continually read all the metadata files to construct a single ‘graph’ describing the energy system.</p>\n<p>This knowledge graph will provide far more than just a catalogue of datasets and assets! The knowledge graph will understand the <em>relationships</em> between things; and will understand the <em>meaning</em> of the descriptions. So users will be able to run queries like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>List all the solar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> systems on constrained parts of the network.</li>\n<li>List all wind farms which openly publish time series datasets recording their outturn.</li>\n<li>List all energy assets, along with their geographical location (to preserve privacy, domestic assets would only show their approximate location)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These queries should return results in a fraction of a second, even though the source data is distributed across many systems.</p>\n<p>Note that we don't need to build a 'full' search engine: The knowledge graph will only crawl <em>energy</em> metadata. It won't attempt to crawl all the linked data on the web! Nor will it store any <em>datasets</em>: The knowledge graph will only copy the <em>meta</em>data.</p>\n<p>There are several off-the-shelf graph databases available: We don't need to invent much technology; we mostly just have to bolt together existing technology.</p>\n<p>How does the knowledge graph find metadata to crawl? To start with, people will manually enter the web addresses of descriptions of energy <em>things</em>. From that first metadata file, the crawler will follow links to other metadata files. As the metadata becomes more interconnected, the crawler will be able to find more and more metadata on its own.</p>\n<p>The knowledge graph may perform other functions: it could track search statistics to allow the community to measure interest in particular datasets; it could validate the metadata it crawls to automatically alert data owners when metadata needs to be fixed; and it could associate datasets with documentation, discussion and tools.</p>\n<p>(The most famous 'knowledge graph' is probably <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph\">Google's knowledge graph</a>. You see results from Google's knowledge graph when Google shows an 'infobox' with search results.)</p>\n<p>Just as there are multiple web search engines, there could be multiple 'energy knowledge graphs'. The source data is distributed and open. And, once users know what data they need, they can go straight to the data source without going through the knowledge graph.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C4YMYOFEiNjYXSK4-wJ8_zZM_q1OKDgRSPNXhnrzr-k/edit#heading=h.rbktb2x5h5c6\">appendix</a> for more information on the knowledge graph for energy data &#x26; assets.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-to-build-a-linked-web-of-energy-data\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-build-a-linked-web-of-energy-data\" aria-label=\"how to build a linked web of energy data permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How to build a linked web of energy data</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Agree on a common technical language for describing energy assets</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, collect the requirements for a common language by surveying existing datasets and talking to the community.

Unnecessary complexity has killed many linked data projects in the past.</li>\n<li>Figure out the technical &#x26; organisational structures to enable the community to evolve the standard over time.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Convert some existing datasets to the new format. e.g.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Renewable Energy Planning Database (REPD)</li>\n<li>System Wide Resource Register (SWRR)</li>\n<li>Embedded Capacity Register (ECR)</li>\n<li>(Once these conversions are done, these datasets will be crawlable by Google Dataset Search)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Work with existing data providers to help them convert their public data to the new format.</li>\n<li>Build a ‘minimal viable product’ of the knowledge graph in the cloud using an off-the-shelf graph database.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build tools to make it as easy as possible to contribute to the ‘linked web of energy data’.

Without Unique IDs, users can't automatically combine datasets or follow links to related assets.</p>\n<p>Imagine running a large international company if the only identifier you have for each employee is their nickname. It would be impossible! Each identifier (nickname) could be associated with thousands of individuals. There'd be no way to distinguish between all the \"Jacks\". Even trivial operations like joining two database tables would be impossible (e.g. one table giving date of birth for each nickname; and another table giving address for each nickname). Companies fix this problem by assigning each employee a unique ID.</p>\n<p>Today, we have multiple energy asset registers in the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> (e.g. FiT &#x26; REPD). These are extremely hard to combine because they do not use universal, unique IDs. Even <em>within</em> some energy companies, different IT systems use different names for the same physical bits of infrastructure! We need to fix this! We need unique IDs. Once we have unique IDs, we can then map existing asset registers onto the unique names, and hence build a complete asset register.</p>\n<h1 id=\"enable-users-to-search-across-assets-and-datasets-at-the-same-time\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#enable-users-to-search-across-assets-and-datasets-at-the-same-time\" aria-label=\"enable users to search across assets and datasets at the same time permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Enable users to search across assets and datasets at the same time</h1>\n<p>Energy assets and energy datasets are intimately linked.

David Sykes's fascinating <a href=\"https://medium.com/@david.sykes70/the-energy-onion-a-simple-conceptual-model-for-a-smart-system-3c1f2c5cbd1a\">Energy Onion article</a> gives insight as to how to manage this complexity: by considering the energy system as a sequence of layers:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclimatefix/website/master/src/images/blog/2020-08-18_image_2.png\" alt=\"Energy System Layers\"></p>\n<p>(Image from David's blog)</p>\n<p>This is reminiscent of the way software engineers manage complexity by building layers of abstraction. e.g. Operating systems abstract away the complexity of the hardware. (Or, an even geekier analogy: the TCP/IP networking stack). Maybe David's layers of the energy onion could be thought of as layers of abstraction?</p>\n<p>Inner layers would provide services to the layer immediately above. For example, services which optimise a building's energy assets to maximise self consumption would be entirely responsible for managing assets within each building. This layer would provide services to the next layer: local balancing and cooperation. These two layers would communicate in both directions. But, crucially, the local balancing layer wouldn't try to micromanage individual assets. Instead, it would (politely) ask the building's energy management system to ramp up / ramp down.</p>\n<p>The key to managing complexity is to ensure that outer layers don't micromanage inner layers: An outer layer can't directly control an inner layer's assets. Instead, outer layers must go through the inner layer's interface.</p>\n<p>This way of thinking about the energy system also helps inform our priorities for defining standards for data sharing: The priority is to define data standards for the communication <em>between</em> layers. The communication <em>within</em> layers is an 'implementation detail' that outer layers don't need to worry about.
