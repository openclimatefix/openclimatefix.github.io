For the climate to 'notice', we need to reduce emissions by <em>at least</em> a million tonnes of CO2e per year, and ideally <em>billions</em> of tonnes per year.</p>\n<p>To achieve scale we need to jump over multiple hurdles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have a great research idea.</li>\n<li>Talk to industry to check that your idea solves a real problem.  (I don't know about you, but I find it all to easy to fixate on solving 'toy' problems.  It's essential that we focus on solving 'real' problems.)</li>\n<li>Build a proof-of-concept that demonstrates emission reductions in a controlled environment.</li>\n<li>Build a product (or get your idea implemented into an existing product) that reduces emissions <em>and</em> solves problems that industry cares about, at a price they can afford, and in a way which fits easily into their existing systems.</li>\n<li>Persuade industry to adopt the product / idea.  (Marketing, support, iterating on the product after receiving critical feedback, etc.)</li>\n<li>Become financially  sustainable.</li>\n<li>Reduce emissions!  (Even if you succeed at all the previous steps, that's no guarantee that you'll reduce emissions at scale.  Maybe there's a rebound effect?  Maybe there are some other unintended consequences?)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Projects tend to attract most funding and media attention after completing a proof-of-concept.  But we need to get all the way to the final step before we can be confident that a given intervention will actually reduce emissions at scale.  The systems that we're trying to change (such as the energy system) are enormously complex.  Demonstrating success in a small research setting does not guarantee success at scale (unfortunately!).</p>\n<p>Good luck!  It's gonna be tough.  But we can't fail.  To paraphrase Greta:  If we fail, future generations will never forgive us.  (Sorry to be so gloomy!)</p>\n<p>But it's also technically exciting work (and actually quite good fun!) and there's a great community of people using computer science to mitigate climate change!  So, dive in - we need your help!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 03, 2019","path":"/blog/2019-10-03-using-computing-to-fix-climate-change","title":"Using computing to fix climate change","authorName":"Jack Kelly","authorTwitter":"jack_kelly"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
