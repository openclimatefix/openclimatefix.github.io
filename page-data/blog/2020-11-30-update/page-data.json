Now that things are a tiny bit calmer - not much - we felt like it’s time for another progress update.</p>\n<p>First of all: We will be making some changes to our newsletter. From now on, we will publish a general progress report on what’s going on with OCF roughly every three months. If you want to be kept up to date, make sure to <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/guCjvH\">subscribe to our newsletter now</a>! It’s four emails per year.</p>\n<p>If you want to get updates more frequently make sure to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/openclimatefix\">follow us on Twitter</a> or watch our <a href=\"https://openclimatefix.org/rss.xml\">RSS feed</a> of blog posts.</p>\n<p>Alright, now that’s out of the way, let’s talk about content. A lot has happened with our two existing projects since the last update and we even took on a new project: Open Energy. We are working on enabling the sharing of energy data, but more about that later.</p>\n<h1 id=\"1-nowcasting\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#1-nowcasting\" aria-label=\"1 nowcasting permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>1. Nowcasting</h1>\n<p>For our nowcasting project to predict <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> generation for any point in the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> we made the following progress over the last months:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/terriblylost/status/1289249853554401280\">James</a> did his PhD placement with us for three months and did major work on predicting <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> yield. You can check out his work in our <a href=\"https://github.com/openclimatefix/predict_pv_yield\">predict<em>pv</em>yield repo</a> on GitHub. Thanks, James!</li>\n<li>We had a great UCL MSc student join us for a summer research project on predicting solar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> power output using a couple of satellite images. Here's a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fz-TWKTDLA\">5-minute lighting talk video</a>.

You can find his work in our <a href=\"https://github.com/openclimatefix/metoffice_ec2\">metoffice_ec2 repo</a>. Merci, Tom!</li>\n<li>Jack is laser-focused on building on Neil &#x26; James' great research work and continues to research <abbr title=\"Machine Learning\">ML</abbr> approaches to solar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> Nowcasting</li>\n<li>Our six-month feasibility study together with the European Space Agency came to a close last month. We are now talking with various funders to build a full, open-source <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> Nowcasting product.

At the moment this is not well known in the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> for all but the largest <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> systems - particularly domestic systems are poorly documented.</p>\n<p>Here is the progress we made with the <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> mapping project over the last months:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Based on results of a major crowd-sourcing campaign to create open geographic data, Dan Stowell has just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mclduk/status/1327192431117422595\">released a data set and journal paper</a> covering over 230,000 solar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> installations across the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr>! That’s huge! Thanks so much for all your work, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mclduk\">Dan</a>!</li>\n<li>Two volunteers have been kindly donating their time to develop an app to further boost the crowd-sourcing of solar panel locations.

Open Energy Data</h1>\n<p>This is our new project. <a href=\"https://icebreakerone.org/energy/\">Open Energy</a> is led by <a href=\"https://icebreakerone.org/\">Icebreaker One</a> and supported by <a href=\"https://www.passivsystems.com/\">PassivSystems</a> and us. The ultimate aim is to enable sharing of energy data - focussed initially on <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> data.</p>\n<p>Over the last months we had the following achievements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Together with Icebreaker One and PassivSystems, we've successfully participated and won the first two phases of a three-phase Innovation competition, concluding the second phase at the end of November.</li>\n<li>Built a basic <a href=\"http://search.energydata.org.uk/dataset\">data discoverability prototype</a> (based on CKAN) to help people find relevant datasets in the energy sector.</li>\n<li>Won support from the <a href=\"https://theodi.org/\">Open Data Institute</a> to help us open up solar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> datasets</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>Over the winter we will continue our work on getting some new research results for solar <abbr title=\"Photovoltaics\">PV</abbr> Nowcasting using Machine Learning. We are also writing a load of grant applications and talking to potential partners to help us co-fund the development of Nowcasting! We also hope to release a satellite dataset soon, to enable all you guys to get more involved in our work as well. Exciting stuff. Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>So long!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 30, 2020","path":"/blog/2020-11-30-update","title":"Quarterly Progress Update, Q4 2020","authorName":"Flo Wirtz","authorTwitter":"flowirtz","authorImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclimatefix/website/master/src/images/people/flo.jpg","coverImageUnsplashId":"cxoR55-bels","coverImagePhotographerName":"Markus Winkler"}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/2021-01-05-values"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/2020-08-18-linked-data-energy-sys"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
