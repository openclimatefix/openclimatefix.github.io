This is awesome.</p>\n<p>It's also clear that we need somewhere for this community to gather, exchange ideas, connect, work on each other's projects, and generally support each other.  The message could be: \"yes, fixing climate change is going to be very hard.  But look at all these amazing people who are already doing impactful work.  You can join in, and here's how!\"</p>\n<p>Maybe this would be a blog and/or a YouTube channel and/or a podcast.  Some content written by journalists.  Some content written by the people who are already running projects.  And/or a mailing list.  Perhaps with a database of projects.</p>\n<p>The focus would be on practical, scalable projects, happening right now.  Lots of juicy detail where appropriate.</p>\n<p>The target audience would be skilled people who can actually get stuck into projects - either just a few hours a month, or by leaving their current job and diving in head-first.</p>\n<p>This wouldn't be an academic journal - the focus would be on practical interventions, and the content would be attractive and fun to read.</p>\n<p>There would also be a strong focus on the climate impact - if an intervention is, at best, only going to save a hundred tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> then that needs to be called out.</p>\n<p>Would this be useful?</p>\n<p>Does anything similar already exist (if so, please link to existing projects in teh comments below!)</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 15, 2019","path":"/blog/2019-01-15-community-platform-for-climate-change-mitigation","title":"Magazine or community platform for people interested in practical action to limit climate change.","authorName":"Jack Kelly","authorTwitter":"jack_kelly"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
