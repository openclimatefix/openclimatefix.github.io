              The dream for the first few years is to build the world’s best
              solar PV nowcasting tool, in collaboration with the research
              community. Release all the code and data. Get state-of-the-art PV
              forecasts into the world’s grid control rooms ASAP. Also provide
              PV forecasts to anyone who wants them (e.g. battery schedulers).
              Paid for by research funding (e.g. NIA). Demonstrate carbon
              savings of more than a million tonnes per year; and sizable
              financial savings for consumers. Operate in a very open and
              collaborative way. Invite the research community to beat our
              nowcasting algorithm and, when they do, help them to get their
              better forecasts into grid control rooms.

              Leveraging that success, we'll pursue funding avenues to scale our
