&lt;h2&gt;The challenge of reducing emissions at scale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quick rant: All the climate cares about is the scale of emissions reductions. For the climate to &apos;notice&apos;, we need to reduce emissions by &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; a million tonnes of CO2e per year, and ideally &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of tonnes per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve scale we need to jump over multiple hurdles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a great research idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to industry to check that your idea solves a real problem. (I don&apos;t know about you, but I find it all to easy to fixate on solving &apos;toy&apos; problems. It&apos;s essential that we focus on solving &apos;real&apos; problems.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a proof-of-concept that demonstrates emission reductions in a controlled environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a product (or get your idea implemented into an existing product) that reduces emissions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; solves problems that industry cares about, at a price they can afford, and in a way which fits easily into their existing systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persuade industry to adopt the product / idea. (Marketing, support, iterating on the product after receiving critical feedback, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become financially sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce emissions! (Even if you succeed at all the previous steps, that&apos;s no guarantee that you&apos;ll reduce emissions at scale. Maybe there&apos;s a rebound effect? Maybe there are some other unintended consequences?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects tend to attract most funding and media attention after completing a proof-of-concept. But we need to get all the way to the final step before we can be confident that a given intervention will actually reduce emissions at scale. The systems that we&apos;re trying to change (such as the energy system) are enormously complex. Demonstrating success in a small research setting does not guarantee success at scale (unfortunately!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck! It&apos;s gonna be tough. But we can&apos;t fail. To paraphrase Greta: If we fail, future generations will never forgive us. (Sorry to be so gloomy!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&apos;s also technically exciting work (and actually quite good fun!) and there&apos;s a great community of people using computer science to mitigate climate change! So, dive in - we need your help!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Starting work on solar PV mapping]]></title><description><![CDATA[Solar PV mapping is a sub-project of our PV nowcasting project.

Nowcasting will provide solar PV yield predictions for any location. To be able to arrive at an accurate forecast for solar power generation (out-turn), we need to know where all the PV panels are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenStreetMap (OSM) community has already done an incredible job mapping over 10,000 PV installations in the UK (out of over 1 million we believe to exist) and many more across the world. Our goal is to help grow the effort and drastically increase the amount of PV mapped in OSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/group/deepsolar/home&quot;&gt;DeepSolar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10895.pdf&quot;&gt;SolarMapper from DUKE&lt;/a&gt; are just two examples) has shown the power of machine learning (ML) for identifying PV panels in satellite and aerial imagery at scale. We want to make it easy for anyone to start using ML to map PV across the world, and help pull together the datasets that are generated into a global open database (which can be used for updating OSM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By creating a comprehensive open database of PV installations, we think that many other people will find interesting ways to use the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK is our initial focus for the nowcasting project, so we have also focused on mapping PV installations there initially. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LaurenceWWatson&quot;&gt;Laurence Watson&lt;/a&gt; has taken up the challenge of mapping UK PV using high-resolution 25cm aerial imagery. Although licensing does not allow the aerial imagery to be shared, we will be open sourcing the methods and tools we use. We are using the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://rastervision.io/&quot;&gt;Raster Vision&lt;/a&gt; framework, which will make it easier for anyone to reuse and contribute to the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in doing a similar ML mapping project in your country (where we can find high resolution imagery), please reach out, as we will be happy to collaborate whilst we do the UK project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other groups doing similar PV mapping projects, and we are excited about the prospect of growing the community, and providing a place for these PV datasets to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can you contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map PV installations manually from street level or satellite imagery directly in OSM. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_Kingdom/Rooftop_Solar_PV&quot;&gt;more details on the OSM wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help us clean and organise PV location data. Could involve GIS work or building software to automate things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribute to existing ML PV mapping projects. There is lots of work to be done improving accuracy of the models. Projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK small scale PV by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LaurenceWWatson&quot;&gt;Laurence Watson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tyler Busby is mapping PV in the USA using Mapbox satellite imagery: &lt;a href=&quot;http://openclimatefix.discourse.group/t/solarpaneldatawrangler/26&quot;&gt;SolarPanelDataWrangler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a new project to map small (residential and business) PV installations in your (or any) country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The aim of this project is to help reduce emissions (and costs) by forecasting solar electricity power production at high temporal and spatial resolution, but with a forecast time horizon of a few hours. We&apos;ll use machine learning to combine satellite images, numerical weather predictions, and live solar PV data. All our research code will be open source; and we&apos;ll blog about our results (including negative results); and we&apos;re working hard to make it easy for other researchers to access the data necessary to do this research :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be kept up to date, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://eepurl.com/guCjvH&quot;&gt;sign up to OCF&apos;s newsletter&lt;/a&gt; (and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack_kelly&quot;&gt;follow Jack on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!). If you&apos;d like to get involved, please register your interest on &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/shrl59GJ96csVF4WB&quot;&gt;OCF&apos;s volunteer register&lt;/a&gt; and/or join the conversations on &lt;a href=&quot;http://openclimatefix.discourse.group/&quot;&gt;OCF&apos;s forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCF is also working on mapping the location of PV panels. We&apos;ll blog about the PV mapping project soon :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is solar electricity nowcasting useful?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several uses for better solar forecasts. One use case that we&apos;re focusing on is to help electricity system operators (like the UK National Grid) to schedule spinning reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physics of the electricity grid dictate that, at every moment, supply must exactly match demand. Small changes in demand are handled automatically: When you turn on your kettle, a generator somewhere on the grid will automatically produce a tiny bit more power. But what if a large cloud covers hundreds of megawatts of solar PV panels? The lost PV generation must be replaced within a few seconds. But it takes many minutes, or even hours, to spin up a natural-gas power plant from cold. So, whenever any solar PV power is on the system, electricity system operators schedule lots of &apos;upwards spinning reserve&apos; (typically thermal generators which are operated at less than 100% capacity, and so can be ramped up quickly to replace lost PV generation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, system operators take a fairly crude and conservative approach to deciding how much spinning reserve to schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With better forecasts for solar PV generation, electricity system operators will be able to schedule spinning reserve more efficiently, which will reduce emissions from the spinning reserve, and reduce costs, and enable the electricity system to handle a greater penetration of solar PV. In particular, we need solar PV nowcasts which do a good job of quantifying &lt;em&gt;uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;. If we&apos;re confident the day will stay sunny, we can schedule less spinning reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our aims is to run a pilot project with at least one electricity system operator, to test if probabilistic PV nowcasts really do help schedule the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conventional forecasting techniques aren&apos;t well suited for solar nowcasting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional forecasting techniques (&apos;numerical weather predictions&apos;) are fantastic at forecasting things like the temperature and wind speeds for tomorrow. But numerical weather predictions aren&apos;t so good at forecasting the amount of sunlight falling on the Earth&apos;s surface (&apos;irradiance&apos;), nor are they great at predicting the next few hours (&apos;nowcasting&apos;). This is for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerical weather models take at least an hour to run and so, by the time they&apos;ve finished executing, they are already an hour out of date with respect to the most recent observations. This isn&apos;t a problem for forecasting temperature. But clouds can change quite dramatically over an hour!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar irradiance is greatly affected by clouds; yet operational numerical weather models can&apos;t resolve clouds. Instead, numerical weather models &apos;parameterise&apos; clouds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &apos;radiative transfer codes&apos; in numerical weather models (the bits which simulate light bouncing around the atmosphere) are some of the most computationally expensive bits of numerical weather models, and so might be run infrequently, or might be run in quite a limited fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historically, there simply hasn&apos;t been much demand for highly accurate forecasts for irradiance. And so not much research has been done on the topic (although that is changing: We&apos;re certainly not the only folks working on solar PV nowcasting!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our planned approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll explore if machine learning (ML) can help nowcast solar PV power production. There&apos;s quite a lot of data available to train ML models; and there are lots of ML engineers who are keen to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we&apos;re planning to work on several distinct ML tasks. In brief, we plan to split the problem into two parts: nowcast the movement of clouds; and then infer solar PV power for a given configuration of the atmosphere. In a little more detail, the steps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infer solar PV yield (normalised by clear-sky PV yield) from satellite images of clouds, and numerical weather predictions. That is, don&apos;t forecast the &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt;, &apos;just&apos; try to learn the &apos;radiative transfer function&apos; of the atmosphere. Learn how different types of clouds and aerosols affect the passage of sunlight through the atmosphere. If this works, then we&apos;ll end up with a system which can tell us the solar PV yield for a single site, given a satellite image of cloud cover over that site, and maybe some data about aerosols, ozone, and water vapour. We can &apos;sweep&apos; this model across large geographical areas to produce a historical &apos;solar PV reanalysis&apos; dataset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how clouds move. We&apos;ll start simple, and use conventional &apos;nowcasting&apos; techniques (Take the most recent satellite image of cloud cover. For each pixel of cloud, move that pixel according to the wind speed and direction at that pixel). Then we&apos;ll try modelling different vertical cloud decks separately (so if high cloud moves over lower cloud, our model should understand that the low cloud probably still exists, even though it&apos;s obscured by the higher cloud). Finally, we&apos;ll try &apos;pure ML&apos; approaches (such as video prediction).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we&apos;ve built a proof-of-concept models for step 1 and 2, we&apos;ll combine these to produce a simple PV nowcasting system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clouds don&apos;t just &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;. Clouds condense out of &apos;nothing&apos;; and evaporate / precipitate away into &apos;nothing&apos;. Clouds change shape; grow vertically; merge; split; change opacity, etc. Can we train a machine learning model to predict how clouds will &apos;evolve&apos; over a few hours?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more detailed plan is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IS0h-W_GyRRUDV8Ur1jiWXYSGZn_Soq-H0UUdvmpXi0/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ultra-open science; and how to get involved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our code will be open (on GitHub); we&apos;ll blog about results (including negative results); we&apos;ll openly discuss ideas and concerns; and we&apos;ll maintain a public &apos;leaderboard&apos; to show how well different models have performed (hopefully, over time, many of those models will be built by other people!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;ll take us another few months to get the project off the ground but, once we do, we&apos;d love people to get involved in the conversations; and to build software tools to help process and visualise the data :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, by far the best way to scale this research across multiple people is probably to enable you folks to try your own modelling approaches (i.e. to take Open Climate Fix out of the loop! You guys just download the data, and maybe use some open-source tools the community develops, and try to beat the current state-of-the-art, and then send your score to the leaderboard)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we write a paper, then everyone who contributes ideas or code will be listed as an author :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;d like to get involved, please register your interest on &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/shrl59GJ96csVF4WB&quot;&gt;OCF&apos;s volunteer register&lt;/a&gt; and/or join the conversations on &lt;a href=&quot;http://openclimatefix.discourse.group/&quot;&gt;OCF&apos;s forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started Open Climate Fix, we hoped to be able to make life super-easy for researchers by collating all relevant datasets into one location. Unfortunately, we&apos;re strictly not allowed to &apos;redistribute&apos; the satellite data, so we can&apos;t collate the satellite data. We&apos;re working on fixing this! But this isn&apos;t a deal-breaker, as each individual researcher can download the historical satellite data for free from the satellite data provider (EUMETSAT). We&apos;ll try to make tools and documentation to make this as painless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re also working hard to get some solar PV power data released into the open.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to get involved with Open Climate Fix]]></title><description><![CDATA[I'm building a non-profit called Open Climate Fix, entirely focused on using open-science to help fix climate change ASAP.

We&apos;d love help :) This blog post lists a few concrete things we need help with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a quick disclaimer: OCF is still very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; young. &lt;del&gt;We don&apos;t yet have funding, a bank account, or an online forum. (These things will come!)&lt;/del&gt; I&apos;m spending the majority of my time meeting people (I&apos;ve had over 100 meetings over the last 7 weeks, and plenty more planned - I&apos;m trying hard to focus on meetings relevant to solar PV now). So, please be patient with me! Once I actually start writing code and releasing data, then there will be much more for folks to get stuck into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, here are a few ideas for how to help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please take a look at our list of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk9cF4O539TzaMaUufn9Ay4f6qKKEyoNKmzP03kbSDo/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Solar data &amp;#x26; software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and add any resources that you can find! e.g. we&apos;d love help locating more sources of satellite data of cloud cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/14UZd_qdAjD8P1VGNQThf3rZz9tBCXk2_ySZ_oNIEdSs/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Solar Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; doc. Please comment on any projects that you&apos;d like to help with. Heck, if you want, please go right ahead and take the lead on any of those projects :) For example, one great stand-alone project would be to build a simple website to allow people to enter the location of PV panels into Open Street Map. (Please comment on the doc if you do go ahead and start work on a project, so we don&apos;t duplicate work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Solar Projects doc includes some &apos;research&apos; sections. These sections contain lists of ideas for self-contained &lt;strong&gt;research projects&lt;/strong&gt;, many of which don&apos;t require any coding (just spending some time googling stuff and/or contacting people). We&apos;d people to take on these research projects!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openclimatefix.org&quot;&gt;openclimatefix.org&lt;/a&gt; website&lt;/strong&gt;! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openclimatefix/openclimatefix.github.io/&quot;&gt;Code is on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;). Feel free to submit pull requests for small changes. For big changes, please describe your proposal in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openclimatefix/openclimatefix.github.io/issues&quot;&gt;the issue queue&lt;/a&gt; before you start coding, just to make sure no one else is already working on something similar! I&apos;m working on some more content, but I&apos;d love help making that content look good :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;We also need a &lt;strong&gt;logo&lt;/strong&gt; :)&lt;/del&gt; [&lt;strong&gt;edit.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;%5BLINKEDIN%5D(https://www.linkedin.com/in/harryolson/)&quot;&gt;Harry Olson&lt;/a&gt; we now have a wonderful logo. Check out his website here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://haocreative.ca&quot;&gt;https://haocreative.ca&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join &lt;a href=&quot;http://openclimatefix.discourse.group&quot;&gt;the OCF web discussion forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data!&lt;/strong&gt; Do you work at an organisation with solar PV power timeseries data or PV location data or satellite imagery? (e.g. an inverter company, or a solar analytics company)? Or do you know someone who does?! If so, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; get in touch. I&apos;m very hungry for good PV data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have PV power data, please either email it to me (jack@OpenClimateFix.org), or upload the power data to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pvoutput.org/&quot;&gt;PVOutput.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain expertise!&lt;/strong&gt; If you know about cloud forecasting / aerosol forecasting / determining the toplogy of the electricity network / related things then please email me (jack@openclimatefix.org)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erm... it&apos;s always awkward talking about &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt; but, um, if you are into climate philanthropy - or if you know of anyone who&apos;s into climate philanthropy - then please email us (info@openclimatefix.org)! My intention is that Open Climate Fix will reduce emissions by millions of tonnes (at least), at a cost of a few dollars per tonne. (i.e. considerably cheaper than most other interventions).&lt;/li&gt;

To mitigate against the risk of a large cloud sweeping across the country (and hence the grid losing gigawatts of PV generation), the National Grid keep lots of natural gas generators idling (&apos;spinning reserve&apos;). These gas turbines are kept idling because they take several hours to start up from cold, but they can be ramped up very quickly from idle; and the physics of the grid dictate that - at every instant - supply must precisely match demand. So, any loss in PV supply must be immediately replaced. Spinning reserve costs a lot of money and pumps out a lot of CO2. If the National Grid had better PV forecasts, even for the next few hours, they could reduce the amount of spinning reserve required, and hence reduce emissions (by about 100,000 tonnes per year) and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nowcasting&quot; is a bit of an odd term. It means &quot;forecasting for the next few hours&quot;. In general, &quot;nowcasting&quot; doesn&apos;t use the hugely complex and expensive numerical weather models that run on super computers and constitute the bread-and-butter for most forecasting agencies. Instead, &quot;nowcasting&quot; usually uses statistical techniques to take recent observations and &apos;roll them forwards&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that most nowcasting research up until now has been done on rainfall (because predicting floods saves lives). Relatively little research has been done on nowcasting sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m a machine learning researcher. So, my main interest is in trying to build machine learning models to nowcast solar PV (which basically boils down to trying to predict the movement and evolution of clouds). I&apos;d like to spend the majority of the next year or two writing code to experiment with new ways to predict sunlight for the next few hours. Inputs to the model may include satellite images of clouds, numerical weather predictions, vertical cloud profiles, and geographical information. As quickly as possible, I&apos;d like to get prototype PV nowcasts displayed in the National Grid control room, so we can start measuring the impact on emissions and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I and my co-conspiriators got our heads round the datasets, we&apos;d love to create an open dataset, so that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can try their hand at beating the state-of-the-art in PV nowcasting :)&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;ve been absolutely blown away by the response! I was expecting maybe a couple of re-tweets. At the time of writing, the tweet has been retweeted 470 times, liked 2.1 thousand times, and I&apos;ve had over 200 messages! To be entirely honest, I&apos;m slightly overwhelmed! (in a good way!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d like to answer some of the great questions that people have asked over the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What stage are you at?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m at the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; beginning of setting up this non-profit! I haven&apos;t settled on a name or precise company structure, I don&apos;t have a website or office, and don&apos;t yet have any funding secured!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have some friends with whom I&apos;ve been discussion this non-profit for the last few months; some of these friends might get involved in the non-profit, although nothing is set-in-stone yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve also been talking to the UK Met Office and National Grid for a little while, and - although nothing is certain yet - it looks very likely that my first project will be forecasting PV in collaboration with the UK Met Office and National Grid. I&apos;m convinced that solar PV forecasting is likely to have significant climate impact, and it&apos;s a good fit for my skills and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do you have a mailing list?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not yet! But I will set one up ASAP. In the mean time, please keep an eye on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack_kelly&quot;&gt;my twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where are you based?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peckham, London, UK :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tell me more about this solar PV nowcasting project.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK! Please see &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2019-01-09-solar-pv-nowcasting&quot;&gt;the Solar PV nowcasting blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Funding?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t have funding yet but I plan to apply to the Network Innovation Allowance soon. This will provide enough money for my time and some compute resources for a year or two; but the NIA unlikely to provide enough money to employ anyone else for the first year or so, I&apos;m afraid - sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&apos;d love to help!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing response to my tweet made it pretty clear that there are loads (thousands?) of highly skilled folks out there who are really keen to help fix climate change. This is fantastic news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the solar PV nowcasting project, I&apos;d love to talk to anyone who has an interest in PV, machine learning (especially video prediction), battery scheduling, grid optimisation, and weather forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll probably spend most of January &apos;just&apos; talking to people :) (That&apos;s what you&apos;re supposed to do at the start of a startup, right?!?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least until the end of January, I doubt I&apos;ll get any significant code written. But, once I do start writing code, I&apos;d love people to critique my preliminary results, and help bounce ideas around. I&apos;ll blog regularly with results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PV nowcasting dataset: Enable anyone to try to beat the state-of-the-art in PV nowcasting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, we plan to put together a dataset and tool chain so &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can try their hand at PV nowcasting. This is really important to me: I want to enable everyone from teenage ML hot-shots to multi-national corporations to try to improve on the state-of-the-art for PV nowcasting. If they succeed in beating the state-of-the-art then I&apos;d like to help get that algorithm into production so it can start making the world better ASAP :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to connect skilled people with projects which need help?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I probably won&apos;t be able to provide meaningful projects for the majority of people who very kindly reached out to me. Which raises the question: How best to allow this awesome group of people to get stuck into helping build stuff which helps to fix climate change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would a database of climate mitigation projects be useful? If you&apos;re looking to work on a project (either paid or unpaid), then you&apos;d look through this database to see if anything takes your fancy. If you&apos;re involved in a project, then you could ask for help. The emphasis would be on open-source projects which help to reduce emissions; but perhaps we&apos;d also allow closed-source projects to advertise? Does that sound useful? If so, would a newsletter be best? Or a blog, which perhaps also publishes interviews etc. with people involved in climate change mitigation? Or a listing on github? Or a forum? Or all of the above? Or does this already exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scaling up the research lab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first year or two, I&apos;d like to focus mostly on solar PV nowcasting; and I&apos;d like to deliberately keep the lab quite small, so that we can be experimental and agile without jeopardising lots of peoples&apos; jobs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the solar PV nowcasting project goes well, and if the open-source approach has proved useful, then I&apos;d like to scale up to a few other projects. This is when the lab would start raising significant amounts of money and employing people to work on a range of projects (all open source; all laser-focused on fixing climate change at scale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Press&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d like to hold off on any press coverage at least for the next few weeks, please! I&apos;d at least like to have settled on a name and set up a mailing list before any articles are published!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I&apos;d feel much more comfortable waiting until this lab has actually had real-world impact before doing any significant publicity. All I&apos;ve done so far is write some blog posts and had a few meetings - stuff that the climate totally doesn&apos;t care about!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Starting a non-profit research lab to help fix climate change ASAP]]></title><description><![CDATA[I left Google DeepMind.

This is a particularly odd decision because I love the team I worked with at DeepMind. Since joining DeepMind, I&apos;ve been constantly amazed by this team&apos;s compassion, focus, intelligence, optimism, and desire for real-world impact. I&apos;ve learnt a huge amount from DeepMind, and I will miss this team dearly. Leaving this awesome team is enormously difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why did I leave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m terrified by climate change; and I&apos;m increasingly convinced that climate change mitigation is a &apos;&lt;em&gt;go big or go home&lt;/em&gt;&apos; thing. I have two ideas for how to help. These ideas might be wrong. But I want to give them a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first idea is motivated by the observation that some business norms (like hoarding intellectual property) get in the way of achieving climate impact. My hope is that it&apos;s possible to design an organisation which is optimised through-and-through for climate impact; and short-circuits all business norms which get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I will build &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfBJ48_hxSEH-XFrwmH0leS4rSsrBKgwzfoeoqGRPfg/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;a non-profit product development lab&lt;/a&gt;, obsessively focused on building things which reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by at least one million tonnes per year; and hopefully &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of tonnes per year. The aim is to catalyse systemic change and help the entire community (including DeepMind!) to have as much climate impact as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll be very collaborative; everything will be open source; and we&apos;ll encourage others to commercialise our work and/or out-perform any systems we build. We&apos;ll aim for maximum CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt; reduction per dollar. The non-profit will combine ideas from open-science and startup culture, and will focus on interventions which are practical and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is probably wildly naive. But I want to test it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second idea is the first project that the non-profit will work on: forecasting solar PV power production a few hours ahead by using machine learning to combine real-time satellite data with numerical weather predictions, in collaboration with the UK Met Office and National Grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don&apos;t interpret my resignation as a comment on DeepMind&apos;s likely climate impact. We all need DeepMind to have huge climate impact. And, if anyone can have impact, it&apos;s the astounding folks in DeepMind. Heck, they already &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/safety-first-ai-autonomous-data-centre-cooling-and-industrial-control/&quot;&gt;are having impact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m extremely excited to start this non-profit; and can&apos;t wait to start building things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll post progress updates to twitter and my blog. Please feel free to email me at jack@OpenClimateFix.org if you&apos;d like more info. I probably won&apos;t get much coding done in January - Jan will mostly be spent setting up the non-profit, building a website etc. And settling on a name!&lt;/p&gt;
